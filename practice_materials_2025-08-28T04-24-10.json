      "content": "Similarly in life, we first bootstrap ourselves via imitation learning (school), which is very reasonable. But even after I graduated school, I had a habit of studying how other people found success and trying to imitate them. Sometimes it worked, but eventually I realized that I would never surpass the full ability of someone else because they were playing to their strengths which I didn’t have. It could be anything from a researcher doing yolo runs more successfully than me because they built the codebase themselves and I didn’t, or a non-AI example would be a soccer player keeping ball possession by leveraging strength that I didn’t have.",
