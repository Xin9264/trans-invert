      "text_content": "### The Decline of College Students' Extracurricular Reading Time\n\nThe chart clearly shows a significant downward trend in the average daily time college students spend on extracurricular reading from 2000 to 2020. In 2000, students spent 120 minutes on it, but this figure dropped to 80 minutes in 2010 and further decreased to 45 minutes in 2020.\n\nThere are several possible reasons for this change. Firstly, with the development of technology, more and more digital entertainment forms have emerged, such as video games and social media, which are more attractive to college students than reading. Secondly, the academic pressure on college students has been increasing. They have to spend more time on courses and assignments, leaving less time for extracurricular activities.\n\nTo reverse this trend, colleges should encourage students to read more by organizing reading activities and setting up reading clubs. Meanwhile, students themselves should also raise their awareness of the importance of reading and make a reasonable schedule to ensure they have enough time for reading.",
      "chinese_translation": "### 大学生课外阅读时间的减少\n\n该图表清晰地显示了从2000年到2020年，大学生每天用于课外阅读的平均时间呈显著下降趋势。2000年，学生们在这方面花费120分钟，但到2010年这一数字降至80分钟，到2020年进一步减少到45分钟。\n\n这一变化可能有几个原因。首先，随着科技的发展，越来越多的数字娱乐形式出现，如电子游戏和社交媒体，它们比阅读对大学生更有吸引力。其次，大学生面临的学业压力一直在增加。他们不得不花更多时间在课程和作业上，从而减少了用于课外活动的时间。\n\n为了扭转这一趋势，高校应该通过组织阅读活动和成立读书俱乐部来鼓励学生多读书。同时，学生自己也应该提高对阅读重要性的认识，并制定合理的时间表，以确保有足够的时间进行阅读。",

      "text_content": "The issue of whether governments should allocate more funds to develop public transportation systems or improve roads and highways has sparked a heated debate. Both views have their own merits and will be discussed below, followed by my personal opinion.\n\nThose who advocate for more investment in public transportation systems emphasize several key benefits. Firstly, public transportation can significantly reduce traffic congestion. By encouraging more people to use buses, subways, and trains, fewer private cars will be on the road, leading to smoother traffic flow. Secondly, it is environmentally friendly. Public transport generally consumes less energy per passenger and emits fewer pollutants compared to individual cars, which is crucial for combating air pollution and climate change. Thirdly, it promotes social equity. People from all income levels can access public transportation, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to travel conveniently.\n\nOn the other hand, proponents of improving roads and highways also have valid points. Well - maintained roads can enhance the safety of all road users. Smooth and well - designed roads reduce the risk of accidents, protecting the lives of drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. Moreover, better roads can boost economic development. They facilitate the transportation of goods and services, making it easier for businesses to operate and expand. For example, trucks can deliver products more efficiently, which is beneficial for the overall economy.\n\nIn my opinion, while improving roads and highways is important, governments should prioritize the development of public transportation systems. Given the current problems of traffic congestion and environmental degradation, public transportation offers a more sustainable solution. It can not only alleviate traffic jams but also contribute to a cleaner and greener environment. Therefore, governments should allocate a larger proportion of their budget to public transportation to build a more efficient and eco - friendly transportation network.\n",
      "chinese_translation": "政府是应该投入更多资金发展公共交通系统，还是改善道路和高速公路，这一问题引发了激烈的争论。两种观点都有其优点，下面将对这两种观点进行讨论，然后给出我个人的看法。\n\n那些主张加大对公共交通系统投资的人强调了几个关键的好处。首先，公共交通可以显著缓解交通拥堵。通过鼓励更多人乘坐公交车、地铁和火车，路上的私家车会减少，从而使交通更加顺畅。其次，它对环境友好。与私家车相比，公共交通通常每位乘客消耗的能源更少，排放的污染物也更少，这对于应对空气污染和气候变化至关重要。第三，它促进了社会公平。所有收入水平的人都可以使用公共交通，确保每个人都有机会便捷出行。\n\n另一方面，支持改善道路和高速公路的人也有合理的理由。维护良好的道路可以提高所有道路使用者的安全性。平坦且设计合理的道路可以降低事故风险，保护司机、乘客和行人的生命安全。此外，更好的道路可以促进经济发展。它们便于货物和服务的运输，使企业更容易运营和扩张。例如，卡车可以更高效地运送产品，这对整体经济有益。\n\n在我看来，虽然改善道路和高速公路很重要，但政府应该优先发展公共交通系统。鉴于当前交通拥堵和环境恶化的问题，公共交通提供了一个更可持续的解决方案。它不仅可以缓解交通堵塞，还能为创造一个更清洁、更绿色的环境做出贡献。因此，政府应该将更大比例的预算分配给公共交通，以建设一个更高效、更环保的交通网络。",

      "text_content": "In modern society, traffic congestion and pollution have become pressing issues. There is a debate about whether governments should invest more in public transportation systems or build more roads. \n\nThose who advocate for investing in public transportation systems have valid reasons. Firstly, an efficient public transportation network can carry a large number of passengers at once. For example, subways and buses can transport hundreds of people in one trip, which means fewer private cars on the road. This directly reduces traffic jams and the amount of exhaust emissions, thus alleviating pollution. Secondly, well - developed public transportation is more accessible to all social classes, especially the poor. It provides them with a convenient and affordable way to commute, improving their quality of life.\n\nOn the other hand, proponents of building more roads also have their points. Building new roads can increase the overall capacity of the transportation system. When there are more roads, cars can be more evenly distributed, reducing the concentration of traffic in certain areas. Moreover, new roads can stimulate economic development in the regions along them. They can attract more businesses and industries, creating job opportunities and promoting local prosperity.\n\nIn my opinion, while building more roads can bring some short - term benefits, investing in public transportation systems is a more sustainable and far - reaching solution. Public transportation can fundamentally change people's travel habits and reduce the reliance on private cars. Governments should allocate more funds to improve the quality and coverage of public transportation, such as upgrading subway lines and increasing bus routes. This way, we can effectively tackle traffic and pollution problems in the long run.",
      "chinese_translation": "在现代社会，交通拥堵和污染已成为紧迫的问题。关于政府是应该更多地投资公共交通系统还是修建更多的道路，存在着一场争论。\n\n那些主张投资公共交通系统的人有合理的理由。首先，一个高效的公共交通网络可以一次性运送大量乘客。例如，地铁和公交车一次可以运送数百人，这意味着路上的私家车会减少。这直接减少了交通堵塞和废气排放量，从而缓解了污染。其次，发达的公共交通对所有社会阶层，尤其是穷人来说更容易使用。它为他们提供了一种方便且经济实惠的通勤方式，提高了他们的生活质量。\n\n另一方面，支持修建更多道路的人也有他们的道理。修建新道路可以提高交通系统的整体容量。当有更多的道路时，汽车可以更均匀地分布，减少某些地区的交通集中。此外，新道路可以刺激沿线地区的经济发展。它们可以吸引更多的企业和产业，创造就业机会，促进当地繁荣。\n\n在我看来，虽然修建更多的道路可以带来一些短期利益，但投资公共交通系统是一个更具可持续性和更有深远意义的解决方案。公共交通可以从根本上改变人们的出行习惯，减少对私家车的依赖。政府应该分配更多资金来提高公共交通的质量和覆盖范围，比如升级地铁线路和增加公交线路。这样，从长远来看，我们可以有效地解决交通和污染问题。",
