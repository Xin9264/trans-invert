      "text_content": "The hunt for the puma began in a small village where a woman picking strawberries saw 'a large cat' only five yards away from her. It immediately ran away when she saw it, and experts confirmed that a puma will not attack a human being unless it is cornered. The search proved difficult, for the puma was often observed at one place in the morning and at another place twenty miles away in the evening. Wherever it went, it left behind it a trail of dead deer and small animals like rabbits. Paw prints were seen in a number of places and puma fur was found clinging to bushes. Several people complained of 'cat-like noises' at night and a businessman on a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree. The experts were now fully convinced that the animal was a puma, but where had it come from? As no pumas had been reported missing from any zoo in the country, this one must have been in the possession of a private collector and somehow managed to escape. The hunt went on for several weeks, but the puma was not caught. It is disturbing to think that a dangerous wild animal is still at large in the quiet countryside.",
      "chinese_translation": "对美洲狮的搜寻开始于一个小村庄，在那里一位采摘草莓的妇女看到‘一只大猫’仅离她五码远。当她看到它时它立即跑开了，而专家们确认一只美洲狮不会攻击人类除非它被逼入绝境。搜寻被证明是困难的，因为美洲狮经常在早上在一个地方被观察到而在晚上在二十英里外的另一个地方。无论它去哪里，它都在身后留下了一串死鹿和小动物如兔子。爪印在许多地方被看见并且美洲狮的皮毛被发现粘在灌木丛上。几个人抱怨在夜间有‘猫一样的噪音’并且一位商人钓鱼旅行时看到美洲狮在树上。专家们现在完全确信这动物是一只美洲狮，但它来自哪里？由于没有美洲狮被报告从这个国家的任何动物园失踪，这一只必定曾属于一位私人收藏家并且以某种方式设法逃脱了。搜寻持续了几个星期，但美洲狮没有被捕获。想到一只危险的野生动物仍然在安静的乡村逍遥法外是令人不安的。",
