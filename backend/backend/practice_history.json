      "text_content": "Environmental degradation has become a pressing global issue, sparking debates about who should bear the primary responsibility for addressing it. While some argue that individuals must lead the effort, others contend that governments and large corporations are more accountable and should take decisive action. This essay will discuss both perspectives before presenting a balanced opinion.\n\nOn the one hand, proponents of individual responsibility emphasize the power of collective action. They argue that if each person adopts eco-friendly habits, such as reducing plastic use, conserving water, and using public transportation, the cumulative effect would be substantial. Furthermore, public demand can drive market changes; for example, when consumers choose sustainable products, companies are incentivized to adopt greener practices. Thus, individual actions not only directly reduce environmental harm but also create bottom-up pressure for broader change.\n\nOn the other hand, many believe that governments and corporations play a more critical role. Large industries are major contributors to pollution and resource depletion due to industrial emissions, deforestation, and waste production. Without strict regulations and corporate accountability, individual efforts may have limited impact. Governments, through policies and legislation, can enforce environmental standards, invest in renewable energy, and impose penalties on polluters. For instance, carbon taxes and subsidies for green technology are effective measures that only authorities can implement.\n\nIn my view, while individual actions are valuable and morally imperative, they are insufficient without systemic support. Governments must establish and enforce environmental laws, while corporations should adopt sustainable practices and innovate eco-friendly technologies. Simultaneously, individuals ought to remain conscientious and support these efforts through daily choices. Ultimately, a collaborative approach involving all stakeholders—individuals, governments, and businesses—is essential for meaningful and lasting environmental protection.\n\nIn conclusion, although individuals contribute significantly to environmental conservation, the primary responsibility lies with governments and large corporations due to their scale and influence. Only through coordinated efforts can we effectively mitigate environmental problems and ensure a sustainable future.",

      "text_content": "In recent years, environmental issues have become a pressing concern across the globe. The debate on whether individuals or governments and large corporations should take the primary responsibility for environmental protection is ongoing. \n\nOn the one hand, there are valid reasons to believe that individuals should shoulder the main responsibility. Firstly, every individual's daily actions can have a cumulative impact on the environment. For example, simple acts like reducing plastic usage, conserving energy at home, and separating waste can contribute to a greener planet. Secondly, by making environmentally - friendly choices, individuals can set a good example for others. When more people see the benefits of these actions, they are more likely to follow suit, creating a positive domino effect.\n\nOn the other hand, governments and large corporations have greater resources and influence. Governments can enact strict environmental laws and regulations. For instance, they can impose high taxes on polluting industries and offer incentives for clean energy development. Large corporations, with their vast production and consumption capabilities, have a significant impact on the environment. They can invest in research and development of more sustainable production methods, reducing their carbon footprint.\n\nIn my opinion, both parties are indispensable in environmental protection. Individuals should continue to make small - scale changes in their daily lives. Meanwhile, governments and large corporations should play a leading role. Governments need to create a favorable policy environment, and large corporations should actively fulfill their social responsibilities. Only through the joint efforts of all parties can we effectively address the escalating environmental problems.\n",

      "text_content": "In recent years, the issue of whether governments should invest heavily in space exploration or focus on solving earthly problems has sparked intense debate. Some governments advocate for large - scale investment in space exploration, and their reasons are quite compelling. Firstly, space exploration can lead to technological breakthroughs. Many of the technologies initially developed for space missions, such as satellite communication and water - purification systems, have found wide applications on Earth, greatly enhancing our quality of life. Secondly, it may offer solutions to long - term human survival. As the Earth faces various challenges like over - population and resource depletion, finding new habitable planets through space exploration could be a potential way out for humanity. \n\nOn the other hand, there are strong voices arguing that the money should be spent on solving problems on Earth. Poverty is a pressing issue in many parts of the world. A significant amount of money could be used to provide basic necessities such as food, shelter, and medical care to the poor. Additionally, environmental problems, including climate change and pollution, pose a direct threat to human existence. Investment in environmental protection projects, like renewable energy development and forest conservation, can help ensure a sustainable future for our planet. \n\nIn my opinion, both aspects are important. While it is essential to allocate sufficient funds to address poverty and environmental problems, which are immediate concerns for human well - being, space exploration should not be neglected. It represents the long - term vision of humanity and may bring about unexpected benefits. Therefore, governments should strike a balance between the two, investing reasonably in space exploration while also making sure that enough resources are dedicated to solving earthly problems.",

In today's competitive job market, having relevant skills and knowledge is crucial for students to secure a good job. Universities can design specialized courses and practical training programs according to the demands of different industries. For example, in the field of information technology, students need to master programming languages and software development skills. By focusing on career - related education, universities can help students become more employable and contribute to the economic development of society.\n\nOn the other hand, proponents of knowledge - for - its - own - sake education emphasize the importance of intellectual exploration. University is a place where students can explore various fields of knowledge without being restricted by the requirements of the job market. They can study philosophy, art, and history, which may not directly lead to a high - paying job but can broaden their horizons, cultivate their critical thinking abilities, and enrich their spiritual world. For instance, studying literature can enhance students' language proficiency and understanding of human nature.\n\nIn my opinion, both views have their merits. A balanced approach is the most appropriate. Universities should not only provide students with career - relevant knowledge and skills but also encourage them to engage in pure knowledge exploration.

In 2000, students spent 120 minutes on it, but this figure dropped to 80 minutes in 2010 and further decreased to 45 minutes in 2020.\n\nThere are several possible reasons for this change. Firstly, with the development of technology, more and more digital entertainment forms have emerged, such as video games and social media, which are more attractive to college students than reading. Secondly, the academic pressure on college students has been increasing. They have to spend more time on courses and assignments, leaving less time for extracurricular activities.\n\nTo reverse this trend, colleges should encourage students to read more by organizing reading activities and setting up reading clubs. Meanwhile, students themselves should also raise their awareness of the importance of reading and make a reasonable schedule to ensure they have enough time for reading.",

      "text_content": "The issue of whether governments should allocate more funds to develop public transportation systems or improve roads and highways has sparked a heated debate. Both views have their own merits and will be discussed below, followed by my personal opinion.\n\nThose who advocate for more investment in public transportation systems emphasize several key benefits. Firstly, public transportation can significantly reduce traffic congestion. By encouraging more people to use buses, subways, and trains, fewer private cars will be on the road, leading to smoother traffic flow. Secondly, it is environmentally friendly. Public transport generally consumes less energy per passenger and emits fewer pollutants compared to individual cars, which is crucial for combating air pollution and climate change. Thirdly, it promotes social equity. People from all income levels can access public transportation, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to travel conveniently.\n\nOn the other hand, proponents of improving roads and highways also have valid points. Well - maintained roads can enhance the safety of all road users. Smooth and well - designed roads reduce the risk of accidents, protecting the lives of drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. Moreover, better roads can boost economic development. They facilitate the transportation of goods and services, making it easier for businesses to operate and expand. For example, trucks can deliver products more efficiently, which is beneficial for the overall economy.\n\nIn my opinion, while improving roads and highways is important, governments should prioritize the development of public transportation systems. Given the current problems of traffic congestion and environmental degradation, public transportation offers a more sustainable solution. It can not only alleviate traffic jams but also contribute to a cleaner and greener environment. Therefore, governments should allocate a larger proportion of their budget to public transportation to build a more efficient and eco - friendly transportation network.\n",

Building new roads can increase the overall capacity of the transportation system. When there are more roads, cars can be more evenly distributed, reducing the concentration of traffic in certain areas. Moreover, new roads can stimulate economic development in the regions along them. They can attract more businesses and industries, creating job opportunities and promoting local prosperity.\n\nIn my opinion, while building more roads can bring some short - term benefits, investing in public transportation systems is a more sustainable and far - reaching solution. Public transportation can fundamentally change people's travel habits and reduce the reliance on private cars. Governments should allocate more funds to improve the quality and coverage of public transportation, such as upgrading subway lines and increasing bus routes. This way, we can effectively tackle traffic and pollution problems in the long run.",
      "chinese_translation": "在现代社会，交通拥堵和污染已成为紧迫的问题。关于政府是应该更多地投资公共交通系统还是修建更多的道路，存在着一场争论。\n\n那些主张投资公共交通系统的人有合理的理由。首先，一个高效的公共交通网络可以一次性运送大量乘客。例如，地铁和公交车一次可以运送数百人，这意味着路上的私家车会减少。这直接减少了交通堵塞和废气排放量，从而缓解了污染。其次，发达的公共交通对所有社会阶层，尤其是穷人来说更容易使用。它为他们提供了一种方便且经济实惠的通勤方式，提高了他们的生活质量。\n\n另一方面，支持修建更多道路的人也有他们的道理。修建新道路可以提高交通系统的整体容量。当有更多的道路时，汽车可以更均匀地分布，减少某些地区的交通集中。此外，新道路可以刺激沿线地区的经济发展。它们可以吸引更多的企业和产业，创造就业机会，促进当地繁荣。\n\n在我看来，虽然修建更多的道路可以带来一些短期利益，但投资公共交通系统是一个更具可持续性和更有深远意义的解决方案。公共交通可以从根本上改变人们的出行习惯，减少对私家车的依赖。政府应该分配更多资金来提高公共交通的质量和覆盖范围，比如升级地铁线路和增加公交线路。这样，从长远来看，我们可以有效地解决交通和污染问题。",
