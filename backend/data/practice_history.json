One day after a massive ant infestation forced the students to eat outside in the hot California sun, Ms. Jenny paused the afternoon’s activities to teach her class an important lesson. Together, they brainstormed about what to do. As the kids shouted out their ideas, Ms. Jenny wrote them down on sticky notes and placed them on the whiteboard. Some ideas were impractical, like eating at Chick-fil-A every day, and others were more bizarre, like just eating the ants for lunch. All ideas were welcome with no filters or fears of judgment, which is a sense of freedom we tend to lose as we grow older. After a bit of time, Ms. Jenny steered the discussion toward a consensus: constructing a sun shade.",

The search proved difficult, for the puma was often observed at one place in the morning and at another place twenty miles away in the evening.

The experts were now fully convinced that the animal was a puma, but where had it come from? As no pumas had been reported missing from any zoo in the country, this one must have been in the possession of a private collector and somehow managed to escape. The hunt went on for several weeks, but the puma was not caught. It is disturbing to think that a dangerous wild animal is still at large in the quiet countryside.",
