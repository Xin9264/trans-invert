But to one degree or another, the work of all but the most highly trained and experienced among them will inevitably contain elements of Chinglish. Chinglish, of course, is that misshapen, hybrid language that is neither English nor Chinese but that might be described as \"English with Chinese characteristics.\"",

      "content": "It follows that any words which perform no useful function in the sentence—that is, which add nothing to the meaning—should be edited out. Almost every text that has been translated into English from Chinese, (or that has been written directly in English by a native speaker of Chinese) contains unnecessary words. Draft translations are commonly full of them, and even polished final versions are seldom free of them.",

      "content": "Jennifer took a deep breath as she looked at the whiteboard covered in square sticky notes, each inscribed with a word or two. In the room, sixteen junior design engineers sat brainstorming solutions to an emergency that had just derailed their day. For the next hour, she facilitated an intense discussion with the group, navigating an ocean of ideas on the board. The goal was simple: narrow the vision to a single solution, create a prototype, then iterate until the problem was solved.",

She was ready to guide these young engineers through a process of thinking that would hopefully lead to a productive outcome. I wasn’t in the room that day, but I saw the final product and it was incredible. The result was beyond anyone’s expectation, and the team was extremely proud of their work.",

      "content": "Jennifer Vasilis (aka Ms. Jenny) was my son’s preschool teacher. One day after a massive ant infestation forced the students to eat outside in the hot California sun, Ms. Jenny paused the afternoon’s activities to teach her class an important lesson. Together, they brainstormed about what to do. As the kids shouted out their ideas, Ms. Jenny wrote them down on sticky notes and placed them on the whiteboard. Some ideas were impractical, like eating at Chick-fil-A every day, and others were more bizarre, like just eating the ants for lunch. All ideas were welcome with no filters or fears of judgment, which is a sense of freedom we tend to lose as we grow older. After a bit of time, Ms. Jenny steered the discussion toward a consensus: constructing a sun shade.",
