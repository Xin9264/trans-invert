But to one degree or another, the work of all but the most highly trained and experienced among them will inevitably contain elements of Chinglish. Chinglish, of course, is that misshapen, hybrid language that is neither English nor Chinese but that might be described as \"English with Chinese characteristics.\"",

Almost every text that has been translated into English from Chinese, (or that has been written directly in English by a native speaker of Chinese) contains unnecessary words. Draft translations are commonly full of them, and even polished final versions are seldom free of them.",

      "content": "Jennifer took a deep breath as she looked at the whiteboard covered in square sticky notes, each inscribed with a word or two. In the room, sixteen junior design engineers sat brainstorming solutions to an emergency that had just derailed their day. For the next hour, she facilitated an intense discussion with the group, navigating an ocean of ideas on the board. The goal was simple: narrow the vision to a single solution, create a prototype, then iterate until the problem was solved.",

      "content": "Jennifer Vasilis (aka Ms. Jenny) was my son’s preschool teacher. One day after a massive ant infestation forced the students to eat outside in the hot California sun, Ms. Jenny paused the afternoon’s activities to teach her class an important lesson. Together, they brainstormed about what to do. As the kids shouted out their ideas, Ms. Jenny wrote them down on sticky notes and placed them on the whiteboard. Some ideas were impractical, like eating at Chick-fil-A every day, and others were more bizarre, like just eating the ants for lunch. All ideas were welcome with no filters or fears of judgment, which is a sense of freedom we tend to lose as we grow older. After a bit of time, Ms. Jenny steered the discussion toward a consensus: constructing a sun shade.",

      "content": "In today's fast-paced world, effective communication has become more important than ever. Many students find themselves struggling to express their ideas clearly in English, especially when discussing complex topics. This article aims to provide practical guidance for improving your language skills through consistent practice and exposure to various contexts.\n\nOne common challenge learners face is maintaining proper tense consistency when describing past events. For instance, when sharing personal experiences, it's crucial to use past forms consistently throughout the narrative. Another aspect worth attention is the appropriate use of prepositions in different situations. Many expressions require specific prepositions that don't always translate directly from Chinese.\n\nTo enhance your learning experience, try incorporating English into your daily routine. Watch English videos with subtitles, read articles on topics that interest you, and practice speaking with friends or language partners. Remember that progress takes time, but with regular effort, you'll notice significant improvements in your fluency and confidence.\n\nDon't be afraid to make mistakes - they are valuable learning opportunities. Keep a notebook to record new vocabulary and review it regularly. Most importantly, enjoy the process of learning and discovering new ways to express yourself in English.",

They didn’t feel the need to know everything about sun shades or construction before beginning—they only needed to know enough to get started.
